## 📖 Details

The **Inventory Management System** is a simple web application built with **Django** to help manage items, vendors, and customer orders.  

It has:
- Role-based access control (admin/staff/customers)
- CRUD operations for items, vendors, and orders
- Dynamic cart management
- Automatic stock visibility

This project was developed as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to demonstrate a scalable inventory app with authentication.

## Next Steps

I have a few ideas in mind that would make the app better, including:
- **Better role based authentication and more role based features**
- **Inventory logs to help aid in analysis**
- **Analysis dashboard for admins to view sales, item popularity, etc.**
- **Order history for customers and admins to view**
- **Adding invoices and emails to the system**
- **Implementing a search function, and filters**
- **Add a better homepage for each user, depending on the role**
- **Fully implement functions and interactions between objects (like when an order gets deleted, add those items back into stock)**
